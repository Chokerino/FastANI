Fast Core-Genome Identity (ANI) Estimation
========================================================================

### Download and compile

Follow [`INSTALL.txt`](INSTALL.txt) to compile the code

### Usage

* **One to One.** Single query and reference genome:

```sh
fastANI -q [QUERY_GENOME] -s [REFERENCE_GENOME] -o [OUTPUT_FILE] 
```

Here QUERY\_GENOME and REFERENCE\_GENOME are the query genome assemblies for which ANI is required.

* **One to Many.** Single query genome and multiple reference genomes:

```sh
fastANI -q [QUERY_GENOME] --sl [REFERENCE_LIST] -o [OUTPUT_FILE]
```

REFERENCE\_LIST is supposed to be a file containing paths to reference genomes, one per line.

* **Many to Many.** Multiple query genomes and multiple reference genomes:

```sh
fastANI --ql [QUERY_LIST] --sl [REFERENCE_LIST] -o [OUTPUT_FILE]
```
Again, QUERY\_LIST and REFERENCE\_LIST are files containing paths to genomes, one per line.

In all above use cases, OUTPUT\_FILE will contain space delimited row(s) with query genome, reference genome, ANI value, count of bidirectional fragment mappings, and total query fragments. Additional log is printed to stderr. Two genome assemblies are provided in [data](data) folder to do an example run. 

We suggest users to do minimal quality check of their input genome assemblies (both reference and query), especially the N50 be â‰¥10 Kbp.
